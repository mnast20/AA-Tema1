The story follows Violet Evergarden's journey of reintegrating back into society after the war is over and her search for her life's purpose now that she is no longer a soldier in order to understand the last words her mentor and guardian, Major Gilbert, had told her: I love you. Violet is a newcomer to the CH Postal Company, and works as an Auto Memory Doll, a ghostwriter for people who cannot write or are looking for help expressing their emotions in letters. As an abandoned and nameless child, Violet was found by navy officer Dietfried Bougainvillea on an island where he and several members of his crew were forced to land after a naval engagement. Her combat prowess was discovered when she killed several soldiers who attempted to hurt her before he could stop them. Violet then stalked and killed all the other crew members. For reasons he did not understand, Violet spared Dietfried and obeyed his orders. Later, Dietfried brought Violet home and gave her to his brother Gilbert in the military as a gift for his promotion to major, intending for Gilbert to use her as a tool for war while not wanting to handle Violet himself. Gilbert instead treated her as a human, taught her how to speak, read, and write, and named her Violet.
