Trie
During his early time as a first-year jujutsu student, Yuji forms quick friendships with Megumi and Nobara Kugisaki, a brash and talented up-and-coming jujutsu sorcerer from Morioka. On a mission to detention center that has become infested with a curse womb forming a special grade Finger Bearer, Megumi encounters Sukuna holding Yuji hostage by ripping his heart out. Unable to do anything, he watches as Yuji seemingly dies from the blood loss. Only known to Gojo and a select number of others, Yuji is still alive and continues to train directly under the mentorship of Gojo in the art of cursed techniques. At the same time, a group of cursed spirits plot a multi-layered attack on the world of jujutsu sorcery, including the cursed spirit Mahito, whose Idle Transfiguration can reshape the soul of any human, and Suguru Geto, a disgruntled jujutsu sorcerer. Gojo is ambushed by one of those cursed spirits, Jogo, whose domain expansion, a barrier technique creating personalized encapsulated space that is destroyed easily by Gojo. Mahito enlists the help of the young Junpei, a boy who has been bullied and wants to use his power to fight back against his oppressors.
