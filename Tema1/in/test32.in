The story takes place in Taisho-era Japan. It follows Tanjiro Kamado and his sister Nezuko Kamado as they seek a cure for Nezuko's demon curse. Tanjiro and Nezuko become entangled in the affairs of a secret society, known as the Demon Slayer Corps, that has been waging a secret war against demons for centuries. The demons are former humans who sold their humanity in exchange for power, and they feed on humans and possess supernatural abilities such as super strength, magic, and regeneration. Demons can only be killed if they're decapitated with weapons crafted from an alloy known as Sun Steel, injected with poison extracted from wisteria flowers, or exposed to sunlight. The Demon Slayers, on the other hand, are entirely human; however, they employ special breathing techniques, known as Breathing Styles, which grant them superhuman strength and increased resistance. Tanjiro Kamado is a kind-hearted and intelligent boy who lives with his family in the mountains. He became his family's breadwinner after his father's death, making trips to the nearby village to sell charcoal. Everything changed when he came home one day to discover that his family was attacked and slaughtered. Tanjiro and his sister were the sole survivors.
